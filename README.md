# movefromsub
A small windows batch script to move up all files from all subdirectories

This script moves all the files from all the subdirectories of the folder in which it is executed to the folder in which it is executed and deletes the remaining empty folder structure.
This is very useful to me and you are free to use and improve it, but please be careful since there is no easy way to restore the folder structure like it was before the use of the script.

I've added an additional version that deletes itself after use, which can be quite handy if you plan on using this more often or calling it from a different program.
